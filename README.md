![Implementation](https://github.com/MatveyMalatsion/mmalatsiontest/blob/master/demoGif.gif?raw=true)

### Known issues:
* Annotation diffing is removed couse of random crashes which I did not have time to fix
* The code is poorly documented
* Minor annotation clustering issues when two points have same location
* Very rare core data related bugs with merging ( just not nave more time to fix it)

Thanks for the opportunity, I hope you find something to praise this implementation.
