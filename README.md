![Implementation](https://b.radikal.ru/b03/1810/5f/f86b976474d2.gif)

##Known issues:
* Annotation diffing is removed couse of random crashes which I did not have time to fix
* The code is poorly documented
* Minor annotation clustering issues when two points have same location
* Very rare core data related bugs with merging ( just not nave more time to fix it)

Thanks for the opportunity, I hope you find something to praise this implementation.
